# gold_extraction_flotation
---
### Project Objective

- Build a model that optimizes the amount of gold extracted from gold ore
---
#### Data Description
**Technological process**

- Rougher feed: raw material  
- Rougher additions (or reagent additions): flotation reagents: xanthate, sulfate, depressant  
  - Xanthate: flotation promoter/collector (activator)  
  - Sulfate: sodium sulfide for this specific process  
  - Depressant: sodium silicate  
- Rougher process: flotation  
- Rougher tails: process residues (tailings)  
- Float banks: flotation unit/bank  
- Cleaner process: purification  
- Rougher Au: rougher gold concentrate  
- Final Au: final gold concentrate

**Stage parameters**

- air amount: air volume  
- fluid levels  
- feed size: feed particle size  
- feed rate
